# eCommerceWebsite_FrontEnd
This is a project that I decide to during my break week from college. I plan to complete the backend in the following weeks.

Pages:
1. Home page:
Contains a navigation bar; a hero; a owl carousel with products; banners that in the future will link to filtered shop pages; and a footers.

2. Shop page:
A page that displays all the products. Contains a navbar; a hero; the products; pagination; and a footer.

3. Product page:
Diplays a single product (can access by clicking in the first product of the Shop page/ Home page. Contains a navbar; a small picture gallery;
product informations section; and a footer.

4. Cart page:
5. Contains a navbar; a table with the products added to the cart; a table with the total value of the products in the cart; and a footer.


I've learned about web programming languages in the past months and I decided to start this project in the my break week.
